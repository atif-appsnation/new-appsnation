                <p>This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how AppsNation, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“AppsNation” or “we” or “us”) uses personal information in running its business. AppsNation is available from its websites, including but not limited to, www.AppsNation.com (“Websites”) and mobile games/applications (“Mobile Apps”). We refer to our Website visitors and Mobile App users as users (“Users”) of AppsNation’s Services (“Services”). Please read our Terms of Service and our “Cookie Policy” provided as Appendix B hereto. By visiting any of the Websites or using any of the Mobile Apps, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h6 class="pt-3">WHAT INFORMATION DOES AppsNation COLLECT?</h6>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>User Provided Information:</strong>&nbsp;We obtain certain information when you provide it to us: for example, if your setup your account profile, participate in a discussion board or report a problem on one of the Websites, you may provide your name, email address, your date of birth, photograph, and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows. Some of that information can be used by AppsNation to identify or contact you directly and is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information.</p>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>Information from Use of our Services:</strong>&nbsp;AppsNation also gathers non-personally identifiable information from Users of our Services. Non-personally identifiable information is information that usually cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, anonymous IDs for advertising, operating system, mobile network information, browser type, existing applications, browsing activity and non-precise device location information (e.g., city or region). AppsNation may enable you to send messages to other Users in the AppsNation community. We ordinarily don’t read the content of these messages unless we reasonably believe the Service is being misused or as required by law; we keep track of the number of messages sent and similar information to keep our Services running smoothly.</p>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>AppsNation Login:</strong> When you login directly through AppsNation, we can access the information you provided during your account profile setup. AppsNation may also incorporate alternative log in methods not listed here, which may follow a similar protocol to the log in methods listed above.</p>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>Device Information:</strong>&nbsp; When you access the Services on your wireless device, we may obtain information from your wireless carrier about the type of device you are using. We may use this information to notify you about what type of features and products from AppsNation may be available to you on your device.</p>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>Mobile Phone Number:</strong>&nbsp; Certain features of the Services may require our collection of the phone number of your device. We may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information. We will not use that number for telemarketing.</p>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp; Depending on the provider, we may automatically receive general location information when you use our Services. In the future, if we begin to offer Services that use technology that pinpoints precise geolocation, we will ensure that we have your consent (an opt-in) before doing so. We may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based Services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising without your express opt-in, which includes communication to third party Services providers who have agreed with AppsNation to keep such information confidential and only use such information to the extent necessary to perform the Services as required by AppsNation.</p>
                <p class="pt-3"><strong>Cookies:</strong> AppsNation uses a number of cookies to collect non-personal information for many purposes. You can see a list of the cookies we use in our “Cookie Policy”&nbsp;provided as Appendix B hereto. Please note that by using the Services you are consenting to the use of cookies.</p>
